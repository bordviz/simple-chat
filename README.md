## Grafana

If you are running a project using Docker and the env mode is `dev` or `prod`, you can monitor logs using the Grafana Loki service. To access the service, go to `http://localhost:3000`, enter `root` as login and `chat-root` as password. In the menu, open the Dashboards tab and select the added `Chat logs` dashboard. 

## Usage
To use the API, you can download the Postman collection [Postman Collection](./Simple%20Chat.postman_collection.json)

The images below show an example of using a websocket for a chat room:
